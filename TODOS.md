- [X] Visualize lanes
- [X] Put two cars on the simulation (both moving)
- [X] Make one of them move via tasks
- [X] Add tasks for: 
    - [X] localization, control
    - [X] opponent localization, opponent lane detection
- [] Task duration change working
- [] Scheduling working (using fixed priorities)
- [] Connect localization task to control task?
- [] Make control take longer during lane transition
